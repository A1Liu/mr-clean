    """ Gets a list of common substrings, ordered by length
    Parameters:
    str_list - list of strings
        List of strings to find the common substrings of
    length - int, default -1
        Lower limit for the length of the strings in the list. All strings with length
        equal to or less than the limit are returned. If set to -1, then all will be returned
    repeats - bool, default True
        Whether or not elements in the list can be substrings of longer elements in the list. 
        
        WARNING:
        If set to false, runtime of this function could increase substantially. Checking for repeats is 
        currently on the order of O(n^2*s) operation, where n is the amount of elements and s is the
        average length of the strings in the list.
    
    Ex:
        substr_list(['asdf','dfwed','_as'])
        output = ['df','as','a','s','d','f','w','e','_']
    
    Ex: 
        substr_list(['asdf','dfwed','_as'],length = 2)
        output = ['df','as']
    Ex:
        substr_list(['asdf','dfwed','_as'],repeats = False)
        output = ['df','as','w','e','_']
